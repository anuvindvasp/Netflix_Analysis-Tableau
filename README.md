## INTRODUCTION

This project presents an interactive analysis of a simulated Netflix user dataset created using Mockaroo, designed to mirror real-world streaming behavior. The dataset includes 1,000 records with attributes such as User ID, Subscription Date, Preferred Genres, Total Watch Time, Device Type, and Account Status, providing a comprehensive view of user engagement and preferences.

Using Tableau, this analysis aims to uncover key insights into:

* Content consumption patterns

* Genre preferences across user segments

* Device usage trends

* Streaming behavior over time

The goal is to leverage these insights to better understand user interaction with the platform and support data-driven decisions that enhance user experience and inform business strategy.

## INSIGHTS

* Sci-Fi and Horror are the most-watched genres

* Majority of users access Netflix via Smartphones

* Active user count increased significantly in recent years

* Older age groups have lower engagement levels

* Recommendation scores impact watch duration

## CONCLUSION

* Subscription growth is steady, but retention is key

* Optimize recommendations for better user engagement

* Target older demographics with personalized content

* Enhance mobile user experience for maximum retention

* Future Work: Deeper analysis with AI-driven insights
